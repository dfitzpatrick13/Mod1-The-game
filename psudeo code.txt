/// general idea of the game and code 
1. Display a welcome message
2. Get user input (rock, paper, or scissors)
3. Generate a random choice for the computer (rock, paper, or scissors)
4. Compare user's choice with computer's choice
   - If they're the same, it's a tie
   - If not, determine the winner based on the rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock)
5. Display the choices made by the user and the computer
6. Display the result (win, lose, or tie)
7. Ask if the user wants to play again
   - If yes, go back to step 2
   - If no, display a goodbye message
